# CLI Init Specification (NEW)

## Purpose

The `openspec init` command SHALL create a complete OpenSpec directory structure in any project, enabling immediate adoption of OpenSpec conventions.

## Behavior

### Directory Creation

WHEN `openspec init` is executed
THEN create the following directory structure:
```
openspec/
├── project.md
├── README.md
├── specs/
└── changes/
    └── archive/
```

### File Generation

The command SHALL generate:
- `README.md` containing complete OpenSpec instructions for AI assistants
- `project.md` with customizable project context template

### Interactive Mode (Default)

WHEN run without flags
THEN prompt user for:
- Project name
- Project description
- Technology stack
- Key conventions

### Non-Interactive Mode

WHEN run with `--yes` flag
THEN use sensible defaults for all prompts

WHEN run with `--no-input` flag
THEN skip all prompts and use minimal defaults

### Safety Checks

WHEN `openspec/` directory already exists
THEN exit with error unless `--force` flag is provided

WHEN `--force` flag is provided
THEN backup existing directory before overwriting

### Exit Codes

- 0: Success
- 1: OpenSpec directory already exists
- 2: Insufficient permissions
- 3: User cancelled operation

## Why

Manual creation of OpenSpec structure is error-prone and creates adoption friction. A standardized init command ensures:
- Consistent structure across all projects
- Proper AI instruction files are always included
- Quick onboarding for new projects
- Clear conventions from the start
