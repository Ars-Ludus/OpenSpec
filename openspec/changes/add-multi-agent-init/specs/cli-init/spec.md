## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Safety Checks
The command SHALL perform safety checks to prevent overwriting existing structures and ensure proper permissions.

#### Scenario: Detecting existing initialization
- **WHEN** the `openspec/` directory already exists
- **THEN** inform the user that OpenSpec is already initialized and skip recreating the base structure
- **AND** continue to the AI tool selection step so additional tools can be configured
- **AND** display the existing-initialization error message only when the user declines to add any AI tools

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Additional AI Tool Initialization
`openspec init` SHALL allow users to add configuration files for new AI coding assistants after the initial setup.

#### Scenario: Configuring an extra tool after initial setup
- **GIVEN** an `openspec/` directory already exists and at least one AI tool file is present
- **WHEN** the user runs `openspec init` and selects a different supported AI tool
- **THEN** generate that tool's configuration files with OpenSpec markers the same way as during first-time initialization
- **AND** leave existing tool configuration files unchanged except for managed sections that need refreshing
- **AND** exit with code 0 and display a success summary highlighting the newly added tool files
