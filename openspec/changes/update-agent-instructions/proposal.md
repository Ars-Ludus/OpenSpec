# Update OpenSpec Agent Instructions

## Why

The current OpenSpec agent instructions need updates to follow best practices for AI assistant instructions (brevity, clarity, removing ambiguity), ensure CLI commands are current with the actual implementation, and properly document the three-stage workflow pattern that agents should follow.

## What Changes

- **Streamline agent instructions** in README.md to be more concise and action-oriented
- **Update CLAUDE.md template** to include the complete workflow documentation
- **Document the 3-stage workflow clearly**:
  1. Creating a change proposal (proposal.md, spec deltas, design.md, tasks.md)
  2. Implementing a change proposal (following tasks, marking completion)
  3. Archiving the change proposal (using archive command after deployment)
- **Update CLI command documentation** to match current implementation:
  - Document `openspec show` command with proper flags and interactive mode
  - Document `openspec archive` command with --skip-specs flag
  - Document `openspec validate` command options
  - Remove references to deprecated commands
- **Add best practices section** for AI agents on being brief and avoiding ambiguity
- **Consolidate redundant sections** to reduce overall instruction length

## Impact

- Affected specs: None (documentation only)
- Affected code: 
  - `src/core/templates/claude-template.ts` - Update CLAUDE.md template
- Affected documentation:
  - `openspec/README.md` - Main OpenSpec instructions
  - CLAUDE.md files generated by `openspec init` command
