# Documentation Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: OpenSpec Agent Instructions

The OpenSpec README.md SHALL provide clear, concise instructions for AI coding assistants working with OpenSpec-enabled projects.

The instructions SHALL:
- Document the three-stage workflow (create proposal, implement, archive)
- Include current CLI command references
- Provide best practices for brevity and clarity
- Be under 50% of the original length while maintaining all critical information

#### Scenario: AI Assistant Creates Change Proposal

GIVEN an AI assistant receives a request for a new feature
WHEN the assistant determines a change proposal is needed
THEN the assistant SHALL:
  1. Create a change directory under `openspec/changes/[descriptive-name]/`
  2. Generate proposal.md with Why, What, and Impact sections
  3. Create spec deltas showing requirements changes
  4. Add tasks.md with implementation checklist
  5. Include design.md if technical decisions are complex

#### Scenario: AI Assistant Implements Approved Change

GIVEN a change proposal has been approved
WHEN the AI assistant implements the change
THEN the assistant SHALL:
  1. Follow the tasks.md checklist exactly
  2. Mark each task complete as finished
  3. Ensure code matches proposed behavior
  4. Update affected tests
  5. Keep the change in the changes/ directory (not archived)

#### Scenario: AI Assistant Archives Completed Change

GIVEN a change has been deployed to production
WHEN the user confirms deployment is complete
THEN the AI assistant SHALL:
  1. Run `openspec archive [change-name]` command
  2. Confirm the change moves to `changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[name]/`
  3. Verify specs are updated with delta changes (unless --skip-specs used)

### Requirement: CLAUDE.md Template

The CLAUDE.md template generated by `openspec init` SHALL provide project-specific OpenSpec instructions.

The template SHALL include:
- OpenSpec marker comments for safe updates
- Three-stage workflow documentation
- Quick CLI reference
- Complexity management guidelines
- Best practices for AI agents

#### Scenario: Initialize New OpenSpec Project

GIVEN a developer runs `openspec init` in a project
WHEN the initialization completes
THEN a CLAUDE.md file SHALL be created containing:
  - The three-stage workflow documentation
  - Quick CLI command reference
  - Complexity management principles
  - Link to full README.md for detailed guidelines
