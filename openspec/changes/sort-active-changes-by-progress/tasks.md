# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Dashboard Sorting Logic
- [ ] 1.1 Update the Active Changes rendering to sort by completion percentage ascending.
- [ ] 1.2 Treat missing progress as 0% and break ties alphabetically by change identifier.

## 2. Verification
- [ ] 2.1 Add tests that cover different completion percentages and tie cases to confirm deterministic ordering.
